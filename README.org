* change-point

Change-point detection is an important engineering problem, and
various methods have been proposed. Many existing methods assume that
each data point observed at each time step is a single
multi-dimensional vector, but to make them applicable to a wider class
of problems, we propose a non-parametric and computationally efficient
method. First, the underlying distribution behind each bag-of-data is
estimated and embedded in the metric space with earth mover's
distance. Then, using the distance-based information estimator, we
evaluate how the sequence of bags-of-data varies in the metric space
to derive a change-point score. A procedure is also incorporated to
adaptively determine the timing of alarms by calculating confidence
intervals for the change-point scores at each time step by means of
Bayesian bootstrap. This makes it possible to avoid false alarms in
noisy situations and to detect changes of various magnitudes.
